## Results
Tests was made for cities from cities_4.txt file, which consist of 10 cities placed in two dimensional space. Each algorithm was ran 30 times, working time and the best score (distance of the best route) were noticed.

The plot below was made for predefined parameters which gave the best results during the tests.

According the plot above, 3 different times were defined (10, 20 and 30 seconds). That times were used as a stop criterion of the algorithms working. The conclusion of the efficiencies were drawn based on the results.
